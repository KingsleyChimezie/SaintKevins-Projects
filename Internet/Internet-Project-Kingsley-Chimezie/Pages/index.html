      <h2>The development of the World Wide Web</h2>
      <p>The internet  is a network of networked computers. The World Wide Web, also known as WWW is  the biggest contributing factor responsible for the growth of the internet. The  World Wide Web has grown considerably over the past 25 years. Web servers  around the world hold resources, pages &amp; data. Using a URL (Uniform  Resource Locator) which is an address of a particular website, you can navigate  around the Web easily. You type your URL into your browser window and your  browser will then locate the website you requested. By clicking on hyperlinks  you can then navigate from one page to another within the website. </p>

      <h2>The Beginning</h2>
      <p><img src="../images/Tim-Berners-Lee.jpg"  alt="" width="300" height="235" class="imageFloat"/>Tim  Berners-Lee introduced the World Wide Web. While working in Switzerland, Tim  Berners-Lee considered how he could place research documents he had across  different computers. Wanting to share his findings and research, he introduced  an idea of a protocol, one that would transmit &amp; link information &amp;  documents across operating systems and all across the Internet. This is now  known as the HTTP (which stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol). </p>
      <p>Using Hypertext  this allowed a person to go from one link to another in a non-linear way.  However this Hypertext already existed. A man named Vanevar Bush had spoken  about it long before in 1945, before computers had even been invented. In 1960  Ted Nelson and Doug Engelbert also spoke of Hypertext. HTML (which stands for Hypertexts  Mark-up Language) was developed to write web pages, this meant numerous  computers with different operating systems could communicate with each other at  one time.</p>
      <p>The first  Web Server, hypermedia browser and Web editor was a NeXT computer used by Mr.  Tim Berners-Lee. In 1991 a Belgian computer scientist named Robert Cailliau,  who had previously worked with Tim Berners-Lee on the WWW project, became the  first Web surfer. He browsed the first website which was put on line on the 6th  August. However it wasn't until 1993 that CERN announced that the World Wide  Web would then be available to everyone for free.</p>

      <section>
      <p>In 1994 Tim  Berners-Lee established a consortium, known as the World Wide Web Consortium or  W3C, the reason for this was that he had consistently refused to sell the Web  as he wanted it to be an open forum and not in any particular organisation or  nations ownership. However he knew that the WWW needed control &amp;  organisation. Membership to the W3C was open to educational bodies,  organisations &amp; commercial &amp; government entities. Membership is not  open to private individuals.</p>
      <p>A graphic  interface browser named 'Mosaic' was developed in 1993 by Marc Andreesen &amp;  his team. It was user friendly &amp; displayed images in line with text within  pages. Up until then you had to link images &amp; display them on a different  page.</p>

      <h2>FACTS</h2>
      <p><b>There are  many browsers available today, some of which include:</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Opera</li>
        <li>Apple Safari</li>
        <li>Google Chrome</li>
        <li>Mozilla Firefox</li>
        <li>Microsoft Internet Explorer</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Around 40%  of our world's population has an internet connection today. It is astonishing  to think that in 1995 less than 10 years ago, it was less than 1%. However,  with the introduction of the internet on mobile phones &amp; the use of  tablets, the internet is easily accessible. The first billion was reached in  2005, the second billion in 2010 and it is estimated that the third billion  will be reached in 2014. An Internet user is defined as a person who has access  to the internet at home, via computer or mobile device.</p>
