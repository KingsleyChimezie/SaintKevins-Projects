      <h2>Personal relations and communications</h2>
      <p>People can email each other and instant message each other online, which is faster and cheaper than using standard postal systems and can also communicate through various social network sites for example, Twitter or Facebook, by posting a status or a tweet. Videos can be uploaded immediately onto YouTube and therefore we can share or view this material.</p>
      
      <p>People can now make computer - to - computer calls, by using websites such as Skype and Google Talk, using a technology called VoIP (which stands for Voice over Internet Protocol). Blogs also known as Web journals can be used to express your views on various things, such as music, clothing and football.</p>

      <p><b>Personal and Professional Training and Development</b></p>
      <p>Nowadays we use the Internet as a resource for personal and professional training and development. College and School students are expected to be familiar with the Internet and most Workplaces also require a familiarity with the Internet and with sending and receiving emails as it is now a standard practice in a lot of office employment. Certain institutions such as the National University in Galway, Trinity College Dublin and many American universities such as Yale, Stanford and Berkeley deliver their entire course online for certain parts of the modules.</p>

      <p><b>Research</b></p>
      <p>Content for research on the Internet is vast and variable. You can download literary masterpieces through the Guntenberg Project and research scientific papers, articles and books. Google has already scanned over 10 million books from major American and European Libraries onto the Internet, which now makes it the worldâ€™s largest library. However there is also an issue on certain websites with content which may not be entirely accurate as there are no borders on the Internet. When researching here are some guidelines to follow:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Check the origin of the source material.</li>
        <li>Know how to use search engines effectively.</li>
        <li>Check for copyright. Copyright restrictions apply on the Internet. Therefore, always ask permission when using other people's work or images. For example, when uploading an artist song on to YouTube. However, you do have permission to reproduce a small part of a work, where it is pertinent.</li>
        <li>Beware of ethical issues, for example plagiarism.</li>
        <li>Beware of any bias that may be apparent - look out for propaganda.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>Commercial, Public Relations &amp; Marketing</b></p>
      <p>Nowadays people use the Internet to make business transactions in their everyday life, for example:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Online Banking</li>
        <li>PayPal</li>
        <li>Email</li>
        <li>Advertising </li>
        <li>Online shopping</li>
        <li>Digital content, i.e. journals, newspapers, audio books &amp; MP3 Tracks.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>An example of the power of the Internet as a resource in the commercial, public relations and marketing fields were shown in the American presidential election in 2008. Barack Obama was elected as the 44th President of the United States. His campaign utilised the Internet effectively, using social networking sites such as Twitter and Facebook to get his message across. While supporters collected funds using databases, sending e-mails and reaching out to Middle America. His campaign was admired far and wide for its skill and effectiveness. President Barack Obama has his own website and still uses the Internet to deliver weekly addresses from the White House.</p>
      
      <p>
Another example is from a case study for social media, the Red Cross posted a fundraising project for Japan on their site in hopes to raise $25,000. However, in one day they raised over $277,995. It is obvious that the effective use of modern technology, combined with personal communication skills and leadership can produce beneficial results. The Internet is changing all the time and as it changes, we also change how we communicate and learn throughout our lives.</p>
