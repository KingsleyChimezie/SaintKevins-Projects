      <h2>The nature of ownership, administration and funding of the Internet</h2>
      <p>As previously stated Tim Berners-Lee, who invented the 'Web' refused to sell it as he wanted it to be an open forum. To this day no one actually owns the internet. The elements of its physical infrastructure such as networks, cables and routers are owned by organisations, commercial institutions, ISPs &amp; government bodies. However the internet itself is not under control of any one government or organisation.</p><br>
      </section>

      <p><b>Administration</b></p>
      
      <p>ISOC's Mission Statement: 'To assure the open development, evolution and use of the Internet for the benefit of all people throughout the world.' It 'facilitates open development of standards, protocols, administration and the technical infrastructure of the internet.'
        All of the international bodies who work together under the mantle of the ISOC (which stands for Internet Society) co-operate together to make sure that the Internet is always functional. It is organised by consensus. Membership of the ISOC is open to any individual.</p>
      
      <p>It is a non-profit organisation, there are over 80 organisations involved and there are offices in Washington and Geneva and chapters all over the world. The board of trustees concerns are about the Internet and its impact on society in general. Founded in 1992, the ISOC was given the right to manage the .org domain in 2002.</p>
      
      <p>The Internet Architecture Board (IAB), Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), Internet Research Task Force (IRTF) and the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) are all groups associated with the ISOC. 
        The IAB offers guidance and advice to the ISOC on architectural procedures and on technologies used on the Internet. Its responsibility is for the editorial management and publication of the RFC (Request for Comments) document series. It is an advisory body of the Internet Society and is chartered as a committee of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).</p>
      
      <p>The main aim of the IETF is to make the Internet work better for everyone. Its mission statement states that it aims to 'make the Internet work better by producing high quality, relevant technical documents that influence the way people design, use and manage the Internet.'
        The IANA is responsible for the global co-ordination of the DNS Root, IP addressing and other Internet protocol resources.
        The IRTF's mission statement is 'To promote research of importance to the evolution of the future Internet by creating focused, long-term and small Research Groups working on topics related to Internet protocols, applications, architecture and technology.'</p>

    <section>
    <p><b>Funding</b></p>
    <p>The ISOC receives its funding from many different sources. Some of which include sponsorships for ISOC events which take place, or funding from individual dues and donations, also contributions including platinum sponsorships from the organisation members and contribution of excess net assets from the Public Interest Registry.</p>
