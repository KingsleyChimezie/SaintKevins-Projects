      <h2 align="center">The historical development of Internet from its inception in the 1960’s (Arpanet) up to 2014</h2>
      <br>
      <p><strong>1962 -</strong> J. C. K Licklider introduced the  idea of a global network. He wanted a world where interconnected networked  computers could talk to each other globally, therefore sharing programmes and  sharing information with each other. </p>
      
      <p><strong>1963 -</strong> The ASCII (which stands for  American Standard Code for Information Interchange) was developed. It was a  universal standard code, allowing machines/computers from different companies  to exchange data/information.</p>
      
      <p><strong>1965 -</strong> Larry Roberts &amp; Thomas  Marill connected the TX-2 Computer which was located in Massachusetts to the  Q-32 computer located in California. It was the first long-distance network  connection to occur &amp; was funded by ARPA. The existing telephone system in  place was too slow to transmit information and the necessity of packet  switching was suggested by Leonard Kleinrock at MIT Lincoln Laboratory in  Massachusetts. A packet Switched network, transmits packets of data and these  packets can follow different routes. The ARPANET became the first network to  use packet switching.</p>
      
      <p><strong>1969 -</strong> The first connection between two  computers on the ARPANET happened.</p>
      
      <p><strong>1971 -</strong> The first microchip was  developed in 1971 by Intel. </p>
      
      <p><strong>1972 -</strong> A man called Mr. Ray Tomlinson  wrote a programme allowing electronic mail transmit over the Arpanet. The email  address which we know as <em>'name@host'</em> was initiated by Mr. Tomlinson. </p>
      
      <p><strong>Mid 1970's -</strong> During the middle of the  1970's, a lot of people who had an interest &amp; a hobby in computers used  kits &amp; started building their own computers. These amateurs started using  the Arpanet to their advantage and started playing games against people in  other cities &amp; connected to bulletins boards.</p>
      
      <p><strong>1977 -</strong> The now well-known brand Apple  started selling the Apple II home computer. Since then they have become one of  the top selling brands today.</p>
      
      <p><strong>1979 -</strong> Usenet was introduced. It is a  distributed system, which means its postings are interchanged between hosts on  a regular basis. It still remains and is a separate part of the Internet and it  features threaded discussion groups which anyone can subscribe to.</p>
      
      <p><strong>1981 –</strong> IBM, one of the biggest companies  in telecommunications launched their personal computer. This was the  predecessor of all todays PC's.</p>
      
      <p><strong>1984 -</strong> Apple introduced its operating  system MAC OS. Also six net domains were established, .com, .org, .mil, .edu,  .gov &amp; .net.</p>
      
      <p><strong>1985 -</strong> Windows 1.0 operating system was  first introduced. It had just a small amount of desktop applications, such as a  clock, a calendar, a calculator &amp; notepad. It was a graphical operating  system shell for MS-DOS.</p>
      
      <p><strong>1990 -</strong> Windows 3.0 was launched with a  print manager, a file manager &amp; a program manager. It also had better icons  and was the first commercial version of windows that was a success.</p>
      
      <p><strong>1993 -</strong> Windows NT (which stands for New  Technology) was introduced. The operating system was 32-bit and the link with  DOS was dropped then.</p>
      
      <p><strong>1995 -</strong> The first cross-platform browser  was released by Microsoft. It was Internet Explorer 2.0.</p>
      
      <p><strong>1996 -</strong> Windows NT (New Technology) was  upgraded to a better version, Windows NT 4.0.</p>
      
      <p><strong>1998 -</strong> Microsoft released the operating  system Windows 98. It was the second major release in the Windows 9x line of systems.  Windows 98 was succeeded by Windows 98 Second Edition in 1999.  </p>
      
      <p><strong>2000 -</strong> Microsoft released a new  operating system called Windows 2000.</p>
      
      <p><strong>2003 -</strong> Windows XP was introduced as  part of the Windows NT family. Windows XP was an advance from the MS-DOS based  versions and was the first version to use product activation to help reduce  software piracy.</p>
      
      <p><strong>2007 -</strong> Microsoft released a new  operating system Windows Vista. It was an operating system for use on personal  computers, including home &amp; business desktops, laptops, tablet PC's &amp;  media center PC's. It boasted redesigned networking, audio, print &amp; display  sub-systems &amp; new multimedia tools such as Windows DVD Maker.</p>
      
      <p><strong>2009 -</strong> Windows 7.0 was released as part  of the Microsoft Windows family. The interface was streamlined and it had a new  redesigned taskbar that allowed applications to be &quot;pinned&quot; to it. It  also included a new file sharing system HomeGroup.</p>
    
    <p><strong>2012 to Present - </strong>Microsoft released  the new improved operating system Windows 8 as part of the Windows NT family.  The development of Windows 8 started before the release of its predecessor Windows  7 in 2009. It introduced major changes to the system's platform and user  interface, therefore its users experience was improved on tablets. Windows was  now competing with mobile operating systems such as Android &amp; IOS. Some of  the changes included a touch-optimized Windows Shell based on Microsoft's metro  design language and a new platform for developing apps with an emphasis on  touchscreen input.</p></section><br><br>
